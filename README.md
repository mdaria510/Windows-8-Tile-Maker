# Windows-8-Tile-Maker
Produces beautiful start screen tiles and optimizes performance of application launch.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to adapt this program for use in Windows 10, as Microsoft has completely changed the way tiles work and made it far more difficult to implement custom tiles. Technically it is just a GUI wrapper for the Oblytile utility, which has been discontinued. A beta version of the program that can retain the additional functionality is included as well, but it can only create basic tiles using the stock icon. YMMV. 

Installation: Create a shortcut to the program in your Windows SendTo folder. (Win + R, then type shell:sendto to open the folder.)

Usage: To create a tile, right click a game or application shortcut, and choose Send To -> Tile Maker. 

For Steam games, it will automatically pull down the proper image from the Steam servers. For other games/programs, you can manually choose images. An excellent resource is http://steambanners.booru.org/index.php for other games/applications.

Additional functionality:
Game Services - You can add the location of installed game services such as Battle.net, Steam, etc - to attempt automatic detection of game location.

Precache - Preload game into memory for enhanced performance - like a RAM drive without the hassle of a RAM drive!

Default Tile Size - The size of the tile which will initially be pinned to the start screen.

Custom Resolution - Useful for games that require desktop resolution to be changed before launching, such as when utilizing DSR with borderless fullscreen games. You can set a custom resolution/refresh rate to be automatically switched to prior to launch.
